On the one hand, tropical rainforests are home to diverse mammals such as the Indri, the aye-aye or the brown mouse lemur and other types of fauna. On the other hand, the marine reserve which extends around 1000km² holds a variety of marine animals as the humpback whale, over 180 kinds of fish and even dugongs.</p>
